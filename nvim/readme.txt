You have a backup file as it was before init_backup.lua. Now we are trying to use only lua files
and the folder structure is as follows:

.config/nvim
			|
			|
			\_lua
			|   |
			|   |
			|	\_ jsaez: Sets, plugins downloaded and general remaps
			|
			|   
			|   
			\_after
				|
				|
				\_ plugin: Configurations and remaps for the different plugins,
				           colorscheme configuration, etc.
